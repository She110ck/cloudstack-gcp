# Apache CloudStack on GCP
Well, it doesn't work actually, because some issues with network. But as a scratch can be used well.

## Terraform
Single instance with own subnet

## Ansible
Need to change templates for your nic. Works perfectly.

## Known issues
Couldn't handle SSVM network routing. Maybe just GCE blocking this particular network packages
